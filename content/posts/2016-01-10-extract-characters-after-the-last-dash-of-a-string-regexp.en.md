I wanted to extract characters after the last dash of a string. Regular expression are such a powerful tool to use in these cases. Here&rsquo;s the one I needed for my problem :

```(\w+)[^-]*$```

Please note that with PHP, you need to use the preg_match method and surround the regexp with slashes.

```php
preg_match ('/(\w+)[^-]*$/', 'cgo3020-red-xs', $results); // returns xs in $results[0]
```

Here&rsquo;s a pretty convenient tool to test your regexp: Â https://regex101.com/
