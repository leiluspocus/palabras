I redesigned my blog. Again.

I've been blogging for 8 years so far and boy, this blog has travelled. 

- Simple HTML files hosted in a French server (Free) üëµüèº
- Wordpress hosted by 1&1
- Jekyll hosted on Github Pages
- Gatsby hosted on Github Pages

Today, this blog is powered by Hugo and hosted by Netlify. And, of course, even though I played with plenty of cool tools, I didn't write articles.

Inspired by a popular series of articles in my previous company [trouvailles de madmoiZelle](https://www.madmoizelle.com/rubriques/pour-rire/trouvailles-dinternet-pour-bien-commencer-la-semaine), I decided to write an article every month, listing all the discoveries I made. And also some random stuff that makes me laugh online. 

Why ? 

1. Easier to find links on my blog than on my twitter feed
2. Keeps me motivated to write
3. Helps me improve my english  

Let's go ! 


## Front 
During the coronavirus confinement, I decided to help the nonprofil Descodeuses as a mentor. I helped women who want to become web developers and it made me do more frontend development than usual, and discover stuff I didn't know. 

IntersectionObserver API provides a way to detect collision of two DOM elements. Its performance is better than having to play with scroll / onResize. Here's a codepen I played with: https://codepen.io/leiluspocus/pen/oNjExNg. 

This demo with Rachelle McAndrews helped me preparing my livecoding about CSS Grids with the members of Descodeuses.

This CSS library can make your HTML document look like a beautiful LateX file https://latex.now.sh/ 

Some "no-class" CSS frameworks like [Water](https://watercss.kognise.dev/) are appearing. Can be useful for MVPs ?

David Walsh made me discover [`AbortController` Interface](https://davidwalsh.name/cancel-fetch) to cancel fetch requests in Javascript.  

## Hugo 
As I said earlier, I redesigned my blog using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and I love it.
The things I enjoy the most: 

- How _fast_ is the local environement !
- Shortcodes you can use in Markdown to integrate tweets, gits, youtube videos...
- How easy you can override the theme

## DevTools 
I feel like I'm always discovering cool stuff on the Chrome Devtools. 

- Copy/Paste CSS from the DOM element (Elements panel).

## Community 

Paola made me discover [Streamyard](https://streamyard.com/), an web app to create livestreams. You can see the result on a meetup with [Ladies of Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGM_kT0KWXA&t=5s). 


## Autres

- [Yoga With Adrienne](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFKE7WVJfvaHW5q283SxchA)
Do I really have to introduce her ? I did the "Home" challenge, it helped me get through quarantine. I hope keeping the Yoga pace after confinement.

A flight tracker. Pretty impressive during quarantine !
