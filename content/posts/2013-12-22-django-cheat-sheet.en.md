Here are couple of useful commands / tutorials (in french sorry!) to get started easily with Django.

**Create a project**

```python django-admin.py startproject project_name```

Manually create a subfolder for HTML templates

**Running servers**

```python manage.py runserver```

**Create an application (inside of a project)** 

```python manage.py startapp blog```
