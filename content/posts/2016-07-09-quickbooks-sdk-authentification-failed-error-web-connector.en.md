I used [this SDK](https://github.com/consolibyte/quickbooks-php) to develop an API that connects directly to Quickbooks.

I had this error once:Â Authentification failed when I tried to fetch data from the API. My identifiers were correct.

The problem came from some warnings I had in my program.

It may sound obvious but make sure you have no PHP errors or warning in your application. Otherwise, the web connector of Quickbooks won&rsquo;t be able to read data from your API.

<u>2017 update</u>
  
Seems like [Quickbooks developed its own SDK.](https://github.com/intuit/QuickBooks-V3-PHP-SDK) It might be a better option to use for your APIs ?
