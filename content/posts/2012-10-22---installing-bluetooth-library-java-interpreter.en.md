When I was installing the bluetooth library, i was told to type the directory where Java Interpreter was installed.

Run the command: 
```
  which java
```
    
It&rsquo;s gonna answer you Â«Â /usr/bin/javaÂ Â», type only Â«Â /usr/binÂ Â» in the shell line and you&rsquo;re good ðŸ™‚ (Mac OS X Lion)
